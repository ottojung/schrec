Original:
(let ((pat (a pat))
      (body-looped (x body-looped))
      (body-not-looped (x y)))
  ((eva1 (g (0) ((g pat (0))))
         (body-looped body-not-looped))))


Step:
(let ((pat (a pat))) (g (0) ((g pat (0)))))
--------
(let ((body-looped (0)) (body-not-looped (x y)))
  (body-looped body-not-looped))
